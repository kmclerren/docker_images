SDESC
This notification indicates that the running
configuration of the managed system has changed
from the CLI.
If the managed system supports a separate 
configuration mode(where the configuration commands 
are entered under a  configuration session which 
affects the running configuration of the system), 
then this notification is sent when the configuration 
mode is exited.
During this configuration session there can be 
one or more running configuration changes.

SDESC
A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in
an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links is about to enter the down
state from some other state (but not from the notPresent
state).  This other state is indicated by the included value
of ifOperStatus.

A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an
agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links left the down state and
transitioned into some other state (but not into the

SDESC
An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMPv2
entity, acting in an agent role, has received a protocol
message that is not properly authenticated.  While all
implementations of the SNMPv2 must be capable of generating
this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates
whether this trap will be generated.
